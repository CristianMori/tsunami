# Printing instructions
I've printed this case with 75% infill to guarantee stability. Use a heatbed to prevent excessive warping.

# Assembly
## Requirements
* 4x m3 screws with 40mm length
* 9x m3 nuts (no washers)

## Procedure
* Put the 4 screws into the bottom half
* Place a nut on the screw right next to the USB-connector and screw it all the way to the bottom
* Insert the tsunami onto the screws
* Secure the tsunami with 4 nuts. Do not overtighten though. Screwing the nuts down with your finger is enough!
* Clean out the top holes so that a nut will fit in snugly
* Place the top half onto the screws, and screw in the screws. Only turn each screw 2 or 3 turns before switching to the next screw to prevent excessive warping
* Place the nuts into the top-side holes and screw the screws in. The screws should NOT extend further than the case! Again, do not overtighten this
